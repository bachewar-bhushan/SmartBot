SmartBot revolutionizes remote monitoring in the petroleum industry with its advanced capabilities. This remote-controlled car, powered by the Blynk IoT app, is equipped with MQ-2, MQ-3, and MQ-135 sensors for real-time data collection in petroleum environments. Continuously logging data to Google Sheets, SmartBot employs the One Class SVM model to detect anomalies, ensuring early identification of potential hazards or irregularities. 

## Components and Functions
1. Raspberry Pi PIco W : The Raspberry Pi Pico W is utilized for transmitting sensor data to Google Sheets via webhooks.
2. ESP8266: The ESP8266 serves as the control unit for SmartBot, allowing it to be remotely controlled via the Blynk IoT app.
3. MQ Sensors: SmartBot is equipped with a range of gas sensors, including the MQ-2, MQ-3, and MQ-135. These sensors detect various gases present in the environment, providing crucial data for monitoring air quality and detecting potential hazards.
4. L298N Motor Driver: The L298N motor driver controls the movement of SmartBot's motors.
5. LEDs: SmartBot features LEDs for visual feedback and indication. These LEDs can be used to indicate various states or conditions of the vehicle
